          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>The Soviet Extinction Event of 1951 is the name given to the series of deaths caused in the U.S.S.R. by the Soviet Genocide Virus throughout 1951. It is commonly pointed to as the end of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, due to the fact that it led to the complete destruction of the Soviet Union's population. What is particularly unique about this event is that it was caused by the first and only, as of June 2024, virus in the world that is able to specifically target a certain ethnicity. Due to this, many theorize to this day that the Soviet Genocide Virus was created in an American-funded lab and used as a weapon to specifically engineer the destruction of the Soviet Union.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
        <p>The U.S.S.R. had previously had great success in protecting itself against epidemics, being one of the first countries in the world to achieve the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of malaria eradication.</p>
        <h2 id="event-details">Event Details</h2>
        <p>The first recorded instances of the Soviet Genocide Virus, formally known as the <i>Russointerfectoremvirus</i>, appeared in multiple Moscow hospitals on January 4th, 1951. Many patients complained about excessive coughing and were sent home after testing negative for a short list of diseases available at the time. Over the following days, the number of patients checking in to hospitals throughout Russia increased exponentially, complaining of either excessive coughing or a plethora of different symptoms. It was announced by Joseph Stalin on January 9th, 1951, that there was an unknown, airborne immunosuppressant virus loose in the nation and that it was in a state of emergency due to the epidemic. Many malaria control stations in the country were converted in an attempt to quarantine patients who were immunosuppressed; however, almost every patient would eventually succumb to internal bleeding and pass away in quarantine after around a week. It is unknown if this internal bleeding was directly caused by the virus or by some disease that was allowed to act on patients due to their immunosuppression.</p>
        <p>Over the course of the four months following the initial release of the virus, the Soviet Union was forced to close multiple public services and watch as the country's infrastructure crumbled. Mass hysteria spread throughout the country as a large portion of the population attempted to escape through the nearest possible border. In response to this, whatever was left of the army was mobilized to the western border to prevent a mass exodus. In addition to this, those who did not succumb immediately to the virus starved to death due to the failure of the Soviet Union's collectivization system. With the armed forces spread thin, most farmers chose to rebel and ration their own crops, and those who continued complying with the government did so in vain, since most collection points would be wiped out by the time their crops arrived.</p>
        <p>By the end of the year, roughly 95% of the Soviet population had died from either starvation or the effects of the virus itself. Those who managed to survive the event continued to live a lifestyle of subsistence agriculture, living in isolation from the rest of the world. These groups mostly consisted of immigrants or groups of people not directly related to any East Slavic descendants.</p>
        <h2 id="theories">Theories</h2>
        <p>Today, it is unknown whether or not the Soviet Genocide Virus was discovered naturally or if it was created in a lab. Because of its extremely aggressive and targeting nature, along with the fact that there is no evidence suggesting that it was in fact man-made, many have been left speculating on its origin.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One theory that was popularized in the United States claims that the Soviet Genocide Virus was in fact being developed within Soviet labs to be used as a weapon against the United States, but that this plan backfired when it managed to escape containment. This theory is backed up by multiple intercepted messages that discuss a weapon of such power. These messages, however, never directly mention that the "weapon" is in fact a virus, which means this theory cannot be truly confirmed.</li>
          <li>A very popular theory in eastern media suggests that the Soviet Genocide Virus was bioengineered by American scientists in order to eliminate the U.S.S.R. completely. This theory derives its believeability from the fact that the two countries were in the midst of an ideological war prior to the event, and the occurrence proved to be very conveniently beneficial to the United States.</li>
          <li>Another theory, popularized in Germany during the 1980's, suggests the Soviet Genocide Virus was contained within a cap of ice on the north-eastern mountains of the Soviet Union. Due to climate change, it is believed that the ice containing the virus thawed. Once the virus came into contact with its first human, one of East Slavic descent, it evolved to weaken only those with traits similar to those of the only humans it had had contact with shortly after its release. This is a relatively unpopular theory compared to the other two listed above.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
        <p>Many historians deem the Soviet Exctinction Event of 1951, and consequently the end of the Cold War, as the starting point of the <b>American Utopian Revolution</b>. Prior to the event, billions of American taxpayer dollars were being invested into the development of war technology, most notably the development of atomic and hydrogen bombs and their delivery mechanisms. Once the need for these weapons dissapeared, the government diverted around 70% of its federal spending from the Department of Defense to a new agency: the Department of Innovation. Said department sought to bolster the creation of technology that would improve the quality of life in America by providing significant investment in many different fields of research. Shortly after its creation in 1952, the Department of Innovation began showing promising results when its backed company, IBM, began selling the Home Computing Machine in 1953. Many other technological and medical innovations would follow, leading America into a period many historians deem "utopian," due to it being characterized by a significant annual growth in America's HDI and a significant decrease in crime rates.</p>
        <p>What remained of the center of the Soviet Union became unclaimed territory due to its post-apocalyptic status. Although many countries would send scouts in the following years to extract any useful resources from the area, there would be no settlements exceeding 100,000 people at any point in the territory. The outskirts of the former country would slowly be absorbed by the nations that previously shared a border with the Soviet Union. Many neighboring countries would occasionally attempt to annex parts of contested territory a few years later, leading to conflicts such as the Iranian-Afghan dispute of 1974 and the Mongolian Rebellion of 1962.</p>
