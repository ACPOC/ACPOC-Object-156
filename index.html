                <h4>Special Containment Procedures:</h4>
                <p>ACP Object-156 has been classified as one of the most difficult objects in the facility to contain. This is due to its highly transmissive nature and near gauranteed infection rates after 5 minutes of exposure to any human being. Initial containment involves keeping any Object-156 samples within a locked, tempered glass box. This box should be held up by a pedestal in the middle of a 3 meter by 3 meter by 3 meter safe room. This safe room must be sealed by four bolt locks and two magnetic locks. Any faculty entering said room must be equipped with a military-grade hazmat suit.</p>
                <p>In the event of any facility breaches or power outages that last an hour or longer, any and all samples of Object-156 should be immediately incinerated. If any faculty within the facility are found to be carrying any instance of Object-156-C within their bloodstream, they are to be euthanized and incinerated as to avoid unnecessary suffering.</p>

                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <p>Object-156, formally known as <i>Russointerfectoremvirus</i> and coloquially known as the Soviet Genocide Virus, is a strain of airborne virus responsible for the <a href="example.com">Soviet Extinction Event of 1951</a>. Prototypes of Object-156 have been in American custody ever since their conception in 1950. When observed under a microscope, most variants of Object-156 tend to form in groups of five.</p>
                <p>The development of Object-156 officially began in 1945 within the labs of <b>(REDACTED LOCATION)</b> as a biological weapon. Its intended purpose was to completely eliminate the U.S.S.R. without drawing any lines of suspicion to the United States as the perpetrator of such an occurrence. The first four years of testing brought mixed results, leading to prototypes which would either be too dangerous or ineffective. It wasn't until the start of the Korean War that the faculty working on Object-156 began making significant advances. By testing on two different subject groups, captured KGB spies and Korean POWs, those responsible for the development of the virus were able to pinpoint the specific DNA code sequences that Object-156 would need to target in order to effectively complete its task. From these advances, three stable variants (that is, variants that showed no ability to evolve and develop sub-strains) were created:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Object-156-A: The first stable variant.</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Progression of symptoms: </li>
                            <ul>
                            <li>1 hour after exposure, infected patients begin coughing and sneezing, to a light extent. </li>
                            <li>3 hours after exposure, infected patients begin developing rashes on their torso and arms. </li>
                            <li>24 hours after exposure, infected patients will either begin to show less severe symptoms or begin coughing violently as the esophagus becomes inflamed. Any patients presenting the former will be free of any traces of Object-156-A after 7 days.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Transmission efficiency: </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>78% of patients exposed directly to the virus for 5 minutes in a controlled environment began showing symptoms after 1 hour.</li>
                            <li>57% of patients exposed to a carrier of the virus (who has been showing symptoms for at least 12 hours) for 5 minutes in a controlled environment began showing symptoms after 1 hour.</li>
                            <li>The patient's ethnicity seemed to have no effect on contamination.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Lethality: 36% mortality rate. All patients who did not appear to have dissipated symptoms after 48 hours died within 7 days. Patient ethnicity seemed to have no effect on lethality.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Object-156-B: The second stable variant.</li>

                            <li>2 hours after exposure, infected patients begin developing large bruises throughout their bodies.</li>
                            <li>Between 3-5 hours after exposure, infected patients suffer from mass internal bleeding in seemingly random locations and pass away.</li>

                            <li>50% of patients exposed to the virus (either directly or through a carrier) for 5 minutes in a controlled environment began showing symptoms after 1 hour.</li>
                            <li>Every single patient who was ethnically Korean became infected with the virus. None of the East Slavic patients involved in the testing of this variant became infected.</li>

                                <li>5 hours after exposure, infected patients begin coughing to a light extent. </li>
                                <li>24 hours after exposure, infected patients* begin coughing violently. Any infected patients of Korean descent cease coughing after 24 hours. </li>
                                <li>Roughly 2 days after exposure, infected patients* will become immunocompromised. </li>
                                <li>4 days after exposure, coughing will cease in infected patients*.</li>
                                <li>7 days after exposure, infected patients* will suffer internal bleeding in the liver, heart, kidneys, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, and brain simultaneously.</li>
                                <li>*(<i>of East Slavic descent) (No patients that have been found to contain less than 20% East Slavic traces in their ancestry have suffered any of these symptoms after being infected with Object-156-C as of June 2024.</i>)</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Transmission efficiency:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>100% of patients exposed to the virus (either directly or through a carrier) for 5 minutes in a controlled environment began showing symptoms after 5 hours. </li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Lethality:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>50% mortality rate (from controlled tests).</li>
                                <li>All infected patients of East Slavic descent died after 7 days. </li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Outside of the military facility holding these variants, traces of Object-156-C can still be found around the outskirts of the former Soviet Union to this day. Although there are multiple cases of carriers of Object-156-C being recorded every year, they go by mostly unnoticed due to their relatively low effect on those who are not, to a large extent, ethnically East Slavic.</p>
